## 0.24.2 - 2023-02-02

### Added

- Pixel Wheels is now available in:
    - Hungarian, thanks to Balázs Úr!
    - Esperanto, thanks to Jorge Maldonado Ventura!
    - Turkish, thanks to nxjosephofficial!

### Fixed

- The display would sometimes stutter during races. That should no longer happen.

- In championships, the player rank could sometimes be wrong in the 2nd or 3rd race.

### Developers

- Logging system has been reworked: it no longer goes through Gdx logging system. This fixes log messages arriving out of order.
