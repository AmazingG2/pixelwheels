There is a new track in the Square Mountains championship. In this new track you race in the snowy forest. Be careful not to hit a tree!

Pixel Wheels is now translated in Swedish, thanks to Sanchez.

The way vehicles are drawn have been improved: vehicle shadows now include shadow for the tires, and when a vehicle goes underwater, its wheels are still drawn.

Driving behavior has been tweaked to be more pleasant.

On Android TV, Pixel Wheels is now listed in games, not in apps.
