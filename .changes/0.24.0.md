## 0.24.0 - 2022-11-22

### Added

- There is a new track in the Square Mountains championship. In this new track you race in the snowy forest. Be careful not to hit a tree! (#182).

- Pixel Wheels is now translated in Swedish, thanks to Sanchez.

- On Desktop, Pixel Wheels now honors the XDG Base Directory environment variables (`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`). The configuration file has moved from `.config/agateau.com/pixelwheels.conf` to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pixelwheels/pixelwheels.conf`. It should be automatically migrated.

### Changed

- The way vehicles are drawn have been improved: vehicle shadows now include shadow for the tires, and when a vehicle goes underwater, its wheels are still drawn.

- Spanish translation received some improvements (Victorhck, #262).

- Driving behavior has been tweaked to be more pleasant.

- It is now possible to pause the game using the 2nd gamepad button.

### Fixed

- On Android TV, Pixel Wheels is now listed in games, not in apps (#276).

- Text no longer overflows its button in the gamepad configuration screen (#224).

### Developers

- Enabling some gameplay-affecting debug settings no longer prevents using locked tracks or vehicles.

- Updated Android SDK to 31, Android Gradle Plugin to 7.2.2, Gradle to 7.3.3 and JDK to 11 (#275).
